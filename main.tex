\section{T P Symmetries}
In S.Weinberg famous textbook about quantum field theory\cite{Weinberg_1995} section 2.6, he discusses parity$\mathcal{P}$ and time inversion$\mathcal{T}$. 
\footnote{I use different notation with Weinberg.}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \mathcal{P}^{\mu}_{\,\,\,\,\nu} = \begin{pmatrix}
            1&0&0&0\\
            0&-1&0&0\\
            0&0&-1&0\\
            0&0&0&-1\\
        \end{pmatrix}\\
        \mathcal{T}_{\,\,\,\,\nu}^{\mu} = \begin{pmatrix}
            -1&0&0&0\\
            0&1&0&0\\
            0&0&1&0\\
            0&0&0&1\\
        \end{pmatrix}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
The operators of $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ are believed to be
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \text{P} \equiv U(\mathcal{P}, 0)\\
        \text{T} \equiv U(\mathcal{T}, 0)
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
He seems to define a new notation that corresponds to not only Lorentz transformation and translation but also parity and time inversion.
The operators of Poincar\'e algebra would transform according to the following law,
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \text{P}U(\Lambda, a)\text{P}^{-1} = U(\mathcal{P}\Lambda\mathcal{P}^{-1}, \mathcal{P}a)\\
        \text{T}U(\Lambda, a)\text{T}^{-1} = U(\mathcal{T}\Lambda\mathcal{T}^{-1}, \mathcal{T}a)
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
I'm confused about what he means,
\begin{quotation}
    These transformation rules incorporate most of what is meant when we say that P or T are 'conserved'.
\end{quotation}

Later, he points out that the above equations of P and T are merely approximation.
These are provided by T. D. Lee, C. N. Yang and others works\cite{PhysRev.104.254}\cite{PhysRevLett.13.138}. 
Before reading the references, I think that the problem arises from that equation (1.0.3) that physicists originally define is wrong, or merely an approximation.
Still, I would like to know why and why it is regarded as approximation.
\section{Lippmann-Schwinger equation}
\begin{equation}
    \Psi_{\alpha}^{+} = \Phi_{\alpha}+\left(E(|\mathbf{k}|-H_{0}+i\epsilon)\right)^{-1}V\Psi_{\alpha}^{+}
\end{equation}
It seems Weinberg's reason\cite{Weinberg_2015} of adding the positive infinitesimal parameter $\epsilon$ is weird, and it is unclear and unintuitive for giving meaning to operator.
Although the sentence of giving meaning to operator is unclear, it is also mentioned in Weinberg's another textbook for quantum field theory\cite{Weinberg_1995_3} that this is because of operator $(E_{\alpha}-H_0)$ isn't invertible, and this is because $E_{\alpha}$ is the eigenvalue of $H_0$; however, restricting the infinitesimal parameter to be positive is still confusing.
Possible solution is to re-derive the Lippmann-Schwinger equation\cite{PhysRev.79.469} in path integral formalism.
\section{Meaning and Function of Potential Operator V}
When we expand the second term of equation (2.0.1) with free-interaction state $\Phi_{\beta}$, we get
\begin{equation}
    \Psi_{\alpha}^{+} = \Phi_{\alpha} + \int{d\beta\,\frac{(\Phi_{\beta}, V\Psi_{\alpha}^{+})}{(E(|\mathbf{k}|)-E_{\beta}+i\epsilon)}\Phi_{\beta}}
\end{equation}
and define the T matrix, which later will be seen in S matrix,
\begin{equation}
    T_{\beta\alpha}^{+} \equiv (\Phi_{\beta}, V\Psi_{\alpha}^{+})
\end{equation}
Now this is weird to me because it is unclear about the inner product between two different vectors from two different Hilbert spaces\footnote{That is, one is one of the eigenvectors of free-interaction $H_0$ and the other is one of the eigenvectors of total Hamiltonian $H$.}.
\section{Notes for Lippmann-Schwinger Equation Paper}
For a system with interaction, its Hamiltonian can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
    H = H_0 + V
\end{equation}
and the time-dependent Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger's equation for a state in Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger's picture
\begin{equation}
    i\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\Psi'(t) = (H_0+V)\Psi'(t)
\end{equation}
and we could define a new state associated with the above state (which is known as interaction picture)
\begin{equation}
    \Psi'(t) = \exp(-iH_0t)\Psi(t)
\end{equation}
thus equation (4.0.2) would become
\[H_0\exp(-iH_0t)\Psi(t)+i\exp(-iH_0t)\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\Psi(t) =\]
\[(H_0+V)\exp(-iH_0t)\Psi(t)\]
by further simplification, we have
\begin{equation}
    i\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\Psi(t) = V(t)\Psi(t)
\end{equation}
where the interaction operator is defined
\begin{equation}
    V(t) = \exp(iH_0t)V\exp(-iH_0t)
\end{equation}
